This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify factors that contribute to churn and predict which customers are likely to leave.

It involves data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and building machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC–AUC.

The goal is to help businesses develop data-driven retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
Developed using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
